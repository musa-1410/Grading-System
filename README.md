# By:- @musa-1410, @SaroshIshaq, @umer33511

Overview
The Grading System Application is a robust tool designed to automate the grading process for educators. It provides a flexible solution for calculating and assigning grades based on absolute and relative grading schemes. By leveraging Python's powerful libraries, the application ensures efficiency, accuracy, and user-friendliness.

# Features
Automated Grading: Simplifies the grading process by integrating file handling, data visualization, and user interactivity.

Flexible Grading Schemes: Supports absolute and relative grading methods, allowing educators to customize grading standards.

Data Visualization: Generates intuitive visualizations, including bar charts and bell curves, to provide insights into grade distributions.

File Handling: Allows users to upload and validate Excel files containing student scores, ensuring data integrity.

Export Capabilities: Enables users to export the final dataset, including calculated scores and assigned grades, in CSV or Excel format.

The Grading System application was developed to provide an automated and flexible solution for calculating and assigning grades. It integrates various functionalities to ensure efficiency and accuracy, making it a versatile tool for educators.

# Methodology
